        <h1>Chivito Recipe</h1>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQkCLOHtcgHU78GeoXGrDyC7WtP4_vFVnBn1A&usqp=CAU" alt="chivito picture in his prime moments">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The chivito is the national sandwich of Uruguay. Its importance in the country is on a par with hamburgers in the United States, fish and chips in the U.K., the Cuban sandwich in Cuba, and steaks in Argentina. This sandwich is not for the faint of heart or appetite, either.</p>
        <p>You might want to eat this with no accompaniments since it is a balanced meal in itself, with plenty of protein, vegetables, and bread. If you do want a side, choose something simple like coleslaw, french fries, or onion rings. A beer is a great way to wash it all down. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices bacon</li>
            <li>2 beef fillet steaks, or 4 thin slices grilled steak</li>
            <li>Coarse salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>4 large sandwich buns, such as large ciabatta rolls</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 head lettuce</li>
            <li>4 slices deli cut ham</li>
            <li>4 slices tomato</li>
            <li>4 slices mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon slices until they are crispy. Set aside on paper towels to cool. </li>
            <li>If you're using steaks, drain the excess bacon fat out of the skillet. Slice each fillet in half crosswise to make 2 thin steaks from each. </li>
            <li>Sprinkle with coarse salt and black pepper. Use a mallet to pound the steaks even thinner. </li>
            <li>Heat the skillet over medium-high heat until hot and place steaks on the skillet. Cook for about 2 minutes per side, or until they reach the desired doneness. Place on paper towels to cool. </li>
            <li>Wipe the skillet clean. Melt the butter over medium heat and fry the eggs sunny-side up until they are done to your preference. </li>
            <li>Preheat your broiler. </li>
            <li>Spread the inside of the buns with ketchup and mayonnaise. Place the lettuce pieces on the bottom halves of the buns. </li>
            <li>Top with each sandwich with 2 slices of bacon, a slice of beef, a slice of ham, a slice of tomato, and a slice of mozzarella. </li>
            <li>Place the uncovered sandwiches under the broiler briefly to melt the cheese. Keep a close eye on the sandwiches so the cheese doesn't burn. </li>
            <li>Remove the sandwiches from the oven and place a fried egg over the cheese, then top with the other half of the bun. Serve immediately. </li>
        </ol>
